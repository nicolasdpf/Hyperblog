Hi I'm Danilo Peña
I'm 23 years old and actually living in Bogotá, Colombia.
I have been studying Multimedia Engineering at the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada in Bogotá city,
I'm on 9th semester of that career, this means that I'm very close to my grade! That's exciting to me!

I was born in Colombia
